OFDM, FBMC and UFMC contains the simulation chain of three signal transmissions in order to evaluate the capacity behavior in presence
of NOMA technique. You can shift the signal in frequency by varying the parameter 'spacing'.
Capacity curves are saved and copied in 'CAPACITY_RESULTS' folder where the comparison among waveform performances is done.
'High' and 'low' performances depends on the power domain multiplexing
